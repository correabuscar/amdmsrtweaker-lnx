Lenovo IdeaPad Z575 (Z575am) A6-3400M APU (UDMA mode gfx card - from BIOS, meaning only APU gfx is used, 
the discreet gfx is disabled from bios, otherwise it would've been the Dynamic option in BIOS)
k10stat options:
all below options are tested with prime95 64bit (Blend)running while the options are active/being set (p95v279.win64)
only one row is tested at a time (by setting all P0 to P7 to same value and having Boost/turbo disabled)
also running OCCT 4.4.0 CPU: OCCT test 64bit Large Data Set 8(automatic) threads at the same time....

temperature is in degrees celsius
tested with AC power (not on battery)

found a new way to test, set all P0-P6 to lowest aka 0/6/200/0.5625V
then set B0 to what you wanna test, and tick Boost, go!
this way transition settling is also tested

5th march:
_	_	12	2	1400	0.8250 fails for sure (2 cores instantly)

_	53	8	2	1200	0.8000 !seems to work (also all above this work)
_	_	8	2	1200	0.7875 seems to be working... but nope failed one core (in place large test of prime95) after 2min; but not the normal test tho
_	_	8	2	1200	0.7750 fails instantly one core



============
NB voltages

--
NB P0 6/6/6/6  666Mhz  normal voltage: 0.9875(rechecked)

0.8375 seems to work but prime95 failed several times(rarely!) but it can't be reproduced
could be prin cpu settings...
!0.8500! which is next should be pretty safe!
ok so while prime95 is running, setting this to 0.8250 will make it fail in like 5 sec
and also 0.8375 fails but only sometimes... but i'm saying 0.8500 is sure to be stable!

--
NB P1 10/10/10/10 400Mhz normal voltage: 0.8875

0.8250 tested ok should go much lower 
0.7625 tested ok so far...
...
0.7000 fails almost instantly with prime95 at 1800mhz cpu, 2 cores fail to round in like 5 sec after setting this;
0.7125 seems stable but maybe's like the 0.8375 for NB P0
!0.7250! is likely most stable (guess)

too bad multipliers(ok dividers) cannot be changed

update 18 feb 2014:
increased all voltages(including NB) by 0.125 due to BSODs and one time comodo firewall crashing
update 22 feb 2014: was already increased NB voltages by another 0.125
so NB P0 is 0.8750 and NB P1 is 0.7500
cpu voltages remained as in 18 feb above.

update 4 march 2014: when the last two states are 400mhz and 200mhz instead of both 800mhz then sometime the programs will hang as if they are in not responding mode in win7
they recover though after like 1 minute, or after replugging the usb mouse. Sometimes the mouse also freezes.
I'm currently trying without the 200Mhz one, as FusionTweaker doesn't accept it, but it accepts the 400mhz one. If it still happens even with 400mhz one (last two are 400mhz currently) then it's clear that the minimum mult must be 8 (800mhz) to avoid such app hangs.

update 5 march 2014: these are the voltages thus far
(the cpu ones are already increased (in table below) from the original table found above by +0.0125 just to be safe; just like we did in 18 feb update above)

CPU:
P-state	mintemp	maxtemp	fid	did	freq	voltage	comment
B0	_	_	28	2	2200	1.0875	
P0	_	_	24	2	2000	1.0250
P1	_	_	20	2	1800	0.9625
P2	_	_	18	2	1700	0.9375
P3	_	_	16	2	1600	0.9000
P4	_	58	12	2	1400	0.8625	
P5	_	54	8	2	1200	0.8125
P6	_	48	16	4	800	0.7125

northbridge voltages(as follows) are already increased by 2 x 0.0125 because they were unstable (prior to 18feb; the table already has this done)
NB:
P-state	multdiv	vid	clk	freq
NBP0	6	0.8750	100	666
NBP1	10	0.7500	100	400
(mult= 40 divided by multdiv)
the only thing changeable is vid (with fusiontweaker) i see no way to change anything else (about NB)

the following is the original table/votages as if nothing is changed
CPU:
====
fid 	did 	freq 	voltage
-----
30	2	2300	1.3250	normal default B0
26	3	1400	1.0625	normal default P0
23	3	1300	1.0250	normal default P1
20	3	1200	0.9875	normal default P2
17	3	1100	0.9750	normal default P3
14	3	1000	0.9625	normal default P4
11	3	900	0.9500	normal default P5
16	4	800	0.9250	normal default P6

so, note that these: http://www.overclock.net/t/1365671/unable-to-overclock-amd-a6-3400m#post_19430939
did not work for me, that is, it seems stable but it will fail prime95 ! at least the 2000Mhz one
this guy is right about 3rd core failing first: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=22253806&sid=1bbb184bf4b10593042f50e1f824eee4#p22253806

NB:
----
P-state	multdiv	vid	clk	freq
NBP0	6	0.9875	100	666
NBP1	10	0.8875	100	400

Something to note about CPU multiplier: although the frequency can be set to below 800Mhz
doing so (for example to 400Mhz and/or 200Mhz) will cause programs to enter "Not Responding" state for like 1 minute or two in windows 7; no idea why, but it wasn't the voltage because I increased it by 0.0250 from the one that I thought was already stable;
but when 800Mhz is lowest used voltage these hangs don't happen; as soon as you add 400Mhz (without the 200Mhz) then they happen; but it's not that often; maybe once per hour or half an hour;
Also all Cool&Quiet (C&Q) was disabled, in the sense that CCC (catalyst) or windows power or whoever does that, they were not doing anything, was set to lowest speed/frequency in CCC and remains this way unchanged (for example when k10stat changes the state for higher, it remains so, nothing changes it back down to lowest state (well P6 aka 800Mhz))
so whatever makes it hang is maybe not an interference between k10stat and other C&Q managers stuff...

in FusionTweaker (reported)state 0 is (k10stat's)B0 and state 1 is P0, state 2 is P1 etc state 8 is P6
